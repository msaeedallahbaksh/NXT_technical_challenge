## üì§ Final Submission Steps

### Repository Preparation
1. **Clean up commit history** - Squash WIP commits, meaningful messages
2. **Remove sensitive data** - No API keys or credentials in code
3. **Update documentation** - Ensure README reflects final implementation
4. **Tag release version** - Create git tag for submission
5. **Test fresh clone** - Verify setup works on clean checkout

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# Final validation commands:

# 1. Fresh environment test
rm -rf node_modules __pycache__ .env
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build

# 2. Functionality test
open http://localhost:3000
# Verify all core features work

# 3. Documentation test  
# Follow your own README setup instructions
# Ensure someone else could run your app
```

## üö® Common Submission Issues

### Frequently Missed Requirements
- **Docker doesn't start** - Port conflicts, missing environment variables
- **SSE connection fails** - CORS issues, EventSource not properly configured
- **Functions incomplete** - Missing validation, poor error handling
- **No context validation** - AI can hallucinate product IDs
- **Poor documentation** - Setup instructions incomplete or unclear

### Last-Minute Fixes
- **Environment variables** - Ensure all required vars documented
- **Port conflicts** - Default ports might be in use
- **Database initialization** - Ensure DB schema creates properly
- **CORS configuration** - Frontend can't connect to backend
- **Error boundaries** - One component failure breaks entire app
